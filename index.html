                    <p>Greetings! My name is Jeremy Joseph Lee. I'm passionate about education, music, coding, and facilitating
                        fun and knowledge--preferably at the same time. I have a BA in anthropology and East Asian studies
                        from the University at Albany, SUNY, and an MA in applied linguistics from the University of Montana.
                        I currently teach English as a Second Language (ESL) to adult learners at the University of Arizona
                        here in Tucson. I've also done teacher training here and in Guangzhou, China, and in Hermosillo,
                        Mexico.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>While facilitating learning is an essential component of my educational methodology, I also love extending
                        that belief to my hobby of serving as a radio DJ. The Waiting Room is a two-hour weekly show on
                        <strong>99.1FM//
                            <a href="https://www.downtownradio.org/" target="_blank">Downtown Radio</a>
                        </strong> hosted by me as my alter ego: DoctorSlow. In this role I curate a live musical "mixtape" of sorts
                        comprised of new, old, local, and international "left-of-the-dial" rock'n'roll. My show airs every
                        Thursday from 7-9am and can be heard over the airwaves in Tucson or streamed worldwide from the website
                        or our mobile app: Downtown Radio Tucson.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>As a fullstack web developer, I hope to bridge these worlds and bring my patience and knowledge as an
                        educator to web projects and bridge the gap between front-end users or clients and the all to often
                        esoteric nature of web design and development. Ideally, I will be able to work with musicians, record
                        labels, or even radio stations and truly see my passions connected and blossom.</p>
